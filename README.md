# Linear_regression_Sensitivity_Analysis
matlab code for linear regression-based sensitivity analysis

## use matlab code
## the matlab-built-in function regress gives a good performance whereas in some cases the PLS_nipals function produces false results, which is accompanied by a warning of matrix singularity, for example:
'Warning: Matrix is close to singular or badly scaled. Results may be inaccurate. RCOND =  7.248587e-18.'
